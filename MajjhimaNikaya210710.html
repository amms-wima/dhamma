He thus recommended that his followers relinquish their clinging, not only to views in their full-blown form as specific positions, but also in their rudimentary form as the categories &amp; relationships that the mind reads into experience. This is a point he makes in the following discourse, which is apparently his response to a particular school of Brahmanical thought that was developing in his time&mdash;the S&#257;&#7749;khya, or classification school. </span></p><p class="c246"><span class="c0">This school had its beginnings in the thought of Udd&#257;laka, a ninth-century B.C. philosopher who posited a &ldquo;root&rdquo;: an abstract principle out of which all things emanate and which remains immanent in all things. Philosophers who carried on this line of thinking offered a variety of theories, based on logic and meditative experience, about the nature of the ultimate root and about the hierarchy of the emanation. Many of their theories were recorded in the Upani&#7779;ads and eventually developed into the classical S&#257;&#7749;khya system around the time of the Buddha. </span></p><p class="c385"><span class="c0">Although the present discourse says nothing about the background of the monks listening to it, the Commentary states that before their ordination they were brahmans, and that even after their ordination they continued to interpret the Buddha&rsquo;s teachings in light of their previous training, which may well have been proto-S&#257;&#7749;khya. If this is so, then the Buddha&rsquo;s opening lines &mdash;&ldquo;I will teach you the sequence of the root of all phenomena&rdquo;&mdash;would have them prepared to hear his contribution to their line of thinking. And, in fact, the list of topics he covers reads like a Buddhist S&#257;&#7749;khya. Paralleling the</span></p><p class="c423"><span class="c0">6 </span></p><p class="c440"><span class="c0">classical S&#257;&#7749;khya, it contains 24 items, begins with the physical world (here, the four physical properties), and leads back through ever more refined &amp; inclusive levels of being &amp; experience, culminating with the ultimate Buddhist concept: unbinding (nibb&#257;na). In the pattern of S&#257;&#7749;khya thought, unbinding would thus be the ultimate &ldquo;root&rdquo; or ground of being immanent in all things and out of which they all emanate. </span></p><p class="c320"><span class="c0">However, instead of following this pattern of thinking, the Buddha attacks it at its very root: the notion of a principle in the abstract, the &ldquo;in&rdquo; (immanence) &amp; &ldquo;out of&rdquo; (emanation) superimposed on experience. Only an uninstructed run of the mill person, he says, would read experience in this way. In contrast, a person in training should look for a different kind of &ldquo;root&rdquo;&mdash;the root of suffering experienced in the present&mdash;and find it in the act of delight. Developing dispassion for that delight, the trainee can then comprehend the process of coming-into-being for what it is, drop all participation in it, and thus achieve true awakening. </span></p><p class="c383"><span class="c0">If the listeners present at this discourse were indeed interested in fitting Buddhist teachings into a S&#257;&#7749;khyan mold, then it&rsquo;s small wonder that they were displeased&mdash;one of the few places where we read of a negative reaction to the Buddha&rsquo;s words. They had hoped to hear his contribution to their project, but instead they hear their whole pattern of thinking &amp; theorizing attacked as ignorant &amp; ill-informed. The Commentary tells us, though, they were later able to overcome their displeasure and eventually attain awakening on listening to the discourse reported in AN 3:126. </span></p><p class="c269"><span class="c0">Although at present we rarely think in the same terms as the S&#257;&#7749;khya philosophers, there has long been&mdash;and still is&mdash;a common tendency to create a &ldquo;Buddhist&rdquo; metaphysics in which the experience of emptiness, the Unconditioned, the Dharma-body, Buddha-nature, rigpa, etc., is said to </span></p><p class="c349"><span class="c0">function as the ground of being from which the &ldquo;All&rdquo;&mdash;the entirety of our sensory &amp; mental experience&mdash;is said to spring and to which we return when we meditate. Some people think that these theories are the inventions of scholars without any direct meditative experience, but actually they have most often originated among meditators, who label (or in the words of the discourse, &ldquo;perceive&rdquo;) a particular meditative experience as the ultimate goal, identify with it in a subtle way (as when we are told that &ldquo;we are the knowing&rdquo;), and</span></p><p class="c419"><span class="c0">7 </span></p><p class="c191"><span class="c0">then suppose that level of experience to be the ground of being out of which all other experience comes. </span></p><p class="c362"><span class="c0">Any teaching that follows these lines would be subject to the same criticism that the Buddha directed against the monks who first heard this discourse. </span></p><p class="c225"><span class="c0">* * * </span></p><p class="c318"><span class="c0">I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Ukka&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;, in the shade of a royal Sal tree in the Very Blessed Forest.

This being so, he doesn&rsquo;t attend to ideas fit for attention and attends (instead) to ideas unfit for attention. </span></p><p class="c279"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises in him, and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases; the unarisen effluent of becoming arises in him, and the arisen effluent</span></p><p class="c145"><span class="c0">15 </span></p><p class="c121"><span class="c0">of becoming increases; the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises in him, and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases.

These are the ideas fit for attention that he doesn&rsquo;t attend to. Through his attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his not attending to ideas fit for attention, both unarisen effluents arise in him, and arisen effluents increase. </span></p><p class="c211"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is how he attends inappropriately: &lsquo;Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past? Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?&rsquo; Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present: &lsquo;Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c420"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of view arises in him: The view I have a self arises in him as true &amp; established, or the view I have no self &hellip; or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self &hellip; or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive not self &hellip; or the view It is precisely by means of not-self that I perceive self arises in him as true &amp; established, or else he has a view like this: This very self of mine&mdash;the knower that is sensitive here &amp; there to the ripening of good &amp; bad actions&mdash;is the self of mine that is constant, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and will endure as long as eternity. This is called a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the uninstructed run of-the-mill person is not freed from birth, aging, &amp; death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. He is not freed, I tell you, from suffering &amp; stress.</span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c0">16 </span></p><p class="c245"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones&mdash;who has regard for noble ones, is well-versed &amp; disciplined in their Dhamma; who has regard for people of integrity, is well-versed &amp; disciplined in their Dhamma&mdash;discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention.

There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, dwells restrained with the restraint of the eye-faculty.

There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, uses the robe simply to counteract cold, to counteract heat, to counteract the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, &amp; reptiles; simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shame. </span></p><p class="c254"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Reflecting appropriately, he uses alms food, not playfully, nor for intoxication, nor for putting on bulk, nor for beautification; but simply for the survival &amp; continuance of this body, for ending its afflictions, for the support of the holy life, thinking, &lsquo;Thus will I destroy old feelings (of </span></p><p class="c426"><span class="c0">hunger) and not create new feelings (from overeating).

These are called the effluents to be abandoned by using. &ldquo;[4] And what are the effluents to be abandoned by tolerating? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, endures. He tolerates cold, heat, hunger, &amp; thirst; the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, &amp; reptiles; ill-spoken, unwelcome words &amp; bodily feelings that, when they arise, are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, disagreeable, displeasing, &amp; menacing to life. The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to tolerate these things do not arise for him when he tolerates them. These are called the effluents to be abandoned by tolerating. &ldquo;[5] And what are the effluents to be abandoned by avoiding? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild bull, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, a bramble patch, a chasm, a cliff, a cesspool, an open sewer. Reflecting appropriately, he avoids sitting in the sorts of unsuitable seats, wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats, and associating with the sorts of bad friends that would make his observant companions in the holy life suspect him of evil conduct. The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to avoid these things do not arise for him when he avoids them. These are called the effluents to be abandoned by avoiding. &ldquo;[6] And what are the effluents to be abandoned by destroying? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, doesn&rsquo;t tolerate an arisen thought of sensuality.

In this discourse, Ven. S&#257;riputta expands the discussion in several directions. He begins by focusing on two concepts that underlie the structure of the four noble truths: the dichotomy of skillful and unskillful action, and the concept of nutriment. </span></p><p class="c380"><span class="c0">Focusing on the dichotomy of skillful and unskillful action draws attention to a general principle of cause and effect&mdash;the fact that actions give results&mdash; and to the particular role of action in determining one&rsquo;s experience of pleasure and pain: Unskillful actions lead to pain, skillful actions to pleasure. The search for the root of skillful and unskillful actions leads ultimately to the mind, because the presence or lack of skill in any action is determined by the mental state motivating it. Thus the issue of skillful and unskillful action provides in a nutshell some of the basic principles of the four noble truths in terms of causality, wise and unwise uses of causality, and the dominant role of the mind in the causal chain leading to happiness or pain. </span></p><p class="c190"><span class="c0">The image of &ldquo;root&rdquo; carries further implications. Because the function of roots is to draw nourishment from the soil, the natural question is: Where do the roots of skillful and unskillful behavior draw their nourishment? This is why the next topic in the sutta is nutriment, which is of two sorts, physical and mental. And implicit in the idea of nutriment is the possibility for a strategy to use nutriment skillfully: If the mental state being nourished is unskillful, it can be overcome by depriving it of nutriment; if it&rsquo;s skillful, it can be fostered by feeding it more (see, for example, SN 46:51). This points to the possibility of training the mind through a strategy of selective feeding and starving, while</span></p><p class="c364"><span class="c0">48 </span></p><p class="c157"><span class="c0">the analysis of mental nutriment shows precisely which events are most basic in the mental food chain: contact, intellectual intention, and consciousness. Ven. S&#257;riputta combines the issues of skillfulness and nutriment by approaching the topic of nutriment with a fourfold framework: nutriment, its origination (nutriment, in turn, has its own food), its cessation (the possibility of starving it of that food), and the path of practice leading to its cessation (the way to starve it). This line of thinking leads naturally to the next topic, in which this same framework is applied to the focal issue of the Buddha&rsquo;s teaching&mdash;suffering and stress&mdash;yielding the four noble truths. In this way, Ven. S&#257;riputta shows how the four noble truths derive from the two topics of skillful/unskillful and nutriment. </span></p><p class="c400"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s interesting to note that both these topics figure prominently in discourses directed at young people. The Buddha&rsquo;s instruction to R&#257;hula in </span><span class="c85">M</span><span class="c107">N&nbsp;61</span><span class="c85">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">focuses on skillful and unskillful behavior; the first of the Novice&rsquo;s Questions (Khp 4), on nutriment. Seeing how basic these concepts are to understanding the role of causality in putting an end to suffering, the Buddha taught them to young people as an entry into the Dhamma. In this sutta, Ven. S&#257;riputta shows how these topics can perform the same function for adults. And perhaps he is also showing us the line of reasoning through which his own first glimpse of the deathless followed upon a simple statement of a causal principle: </span></p><p class="c205"><span class="c0">Whatever phenomena arise from cause: </span></p><p class="c59"><span class="c0">their cause </span></p><p class="c481"><span class="c0">and their cessation. </span></p><p class="c46"><span class="c0">Such is the teaching of the Tath&#257;gata, </span></p><p class="c174"><span class="c0">the Great Contemplative. (Mv.I.23.5) </span></p><p class="c155"><span class="c0">The remainder of this sutta expands on the four noble truths with a reverse order analysis of dependent co-arising. Two features of this section stand out. To begin with, Ven. S&#257;riputta points out that understanding the relationship between any two adjacent factors in the pattern of dependent co-arising provides enough discernment to abandon unskillful obsessions and put an end to suffering. There is no need to comprehend the entire pattern, for the whole is implicit in each paired relationship. This is a point with important practical implications. Sn 3:12 makes the same point, but pairs the objects for contemplation in a different way: Every factor in dependent co-arising is</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c0">49 </span></p><p class="c464"><span class="c0">paired directly with stress. A comparison between these two suttas provides much practical food for thought, showing how the ability to see and comprehend dualities is essential to the Buddha&rsquo;s strategy for discernment and release. </span></p><p class="c460"><span class="c0">Second, Ven. S&#257;riputta here continues the pattern of dependent co-arising past ignorance&mdash;the usual endpoint&mdash;to look for its origination, which is the effluents (&#257;sava). Because these effluents in turn depend on ignorance, the discussion shows how ignorance tends to prompt more ignorance. But, as Ven. S&#257;riputta has demonstrated throughout his discussion, ignorance needn&rsquo;t keep propagating forever. Because it is simply a lack of knowledge in terms of the four noble truths, it can be replaced by knowledge that does look at things in terms of the four noble truths&mdash;the framework derived from the topics of skillful/unskillful and nutriment. When knowledge in terms of this framework is applied at any point in the causal framework, the entire framework dependent on ignorance can be brought to an end. </span></p><p class="c463"><span class="c0">In this way Ven. S&#257;riputta fills in a blank contained in the stock Canonical description of awakening. The central part of that description states, &ldquo;He discerns, as it has come to be, that &#39;This is stress&hellip; This is the origination of stress&hellip; This is the cessation of stress&hellip; This is the way leading to the cessation of stress&hellip; These are effluents&hellip; This is the origination of effluents&hellip; This is the cessation of effluents&hellip; This is the way leading to the cessation of effluents.&rdquo; This description, however, does not explain these last four insights into effluents, nor does it explain how they relate to the four insights into stress. In the last section of this discourse, Ven. S&#257;riputta explains the first of these issues, while in the overall structure of the discourse he explains the second. </span></p><p class="c55"><span class="c0">Ven. S&#257;riputta offers further explanations of right view in two other suttas in the Maj hima Nik&#257;ya. In </span><span class="c85">M</span><span class="c107">N&nbsp;141</span><span class="c85">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">he offers a word-by-word analysis of the four noble truths. In </span><span class="c85">M</span><span class="c107">N&nbsp;28</span><span class="c85">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">he analyzes the first noble truth&mdash;in particular, the form clinging-aggregate&mdash;showing how the comprehension of that one aggregate encompasses the comprehension of all five aggregates, all four noble truths, and the principle of dependent co-arising. </span></p><p class="c225"><span class="c0">* * * </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near S&#257;vatth&#299; in Jeta&rsquo;s Grove, An&#257;thapi&#7751;&#7693;ika&rsquo;s monastery.

The term sati is related to the verb sarati, to remember or to keep in mind. It is sometimes translated as non-reactive awareness, free from agendas, simply present with whatever arises, but the formula for satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na doesn&rsquo;t support that translation. Non-reactive awareness is actually an aspect of equanimity, one of the mental qualities fostered in the course of satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na. The activity of satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na, however, definitely has a motivating agenda: the desire for awakening, which is classed not as a cause of suffering, but as part of the path to its ending (see SN 51:15). The role of mindfulness is to keep the mind properly focused in frames of reference that will give it guidance in what present events to develop, and which ones to abandon, so as to keep it on the path. To make an analogy, awakening is like a mountain on the horizon, the destination to which you are driving a car. Mindfulness is what remembers to keep attention focused on the road to the mountain, rather than letting it stay focused on glimpses of the mountain or get distracted by other paths leading away from the road. </span></p><p class="c164"><span class="c0">Satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na plays a role in many formulations of the path to awakening. In the noble eightfold path, it is the seventh factor, following on right effort and leading to right concentration. In the five strengths and five faculties, it is the third factor, following on persistence and leading to concentration. In the seven factors for awakening, it is the first factor, providing a foundation for the</span></p><p class="c343"><span class="c0">67 </span></p><p class="c331"><span class="c0">remaining six factors: analysis of qualities, persistence, rapture, calm, concentration, and equanimity. </span></p><p class="c135"><span class="c0">The following sutta contains the longest treatment of satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na found in the Canon. However, despite its length, its treatment of the topic is far from complete. This partly has to do with the nature of the topic itself. As the Buddha states in MN 12: </span></p><p class="c483"><span class="c0">&ldquo;S&#257;riputta, suppose that I had four disciples with a 100-year life span, living for 100 years, and endowed with excellent </span></p><p class="c388"><span class="c0">mindfulness, retention, recall, &amp; keenness of discernment. Just as an archer with a good bow&mdash;trained, dexterous, &amp; practiced&mdash; could easily shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palmyra tree, they&mdash;endowed with that great an extent of mindfulness, that great an extent of retention, that great an extent of recall, &amp; that keenness of discernment&mdash;would ask me one question after another on the four establishings of mindfulness. And I, asked again &amp; again, would answer. Answered, they would remember what I had answered, and they wouldn&rsquo;t counter-question me about it a second time more. Aside from eating, drinking, chewing, &amp; savoring, aside from urinating &amp; defecating, aside from relieving sleepiness &amp; weariness, there would be no ending of the Tath&#257;gata&rsquo;s Dhamma teaching, there would be no ending of the Tath&#257;gata&rsquo;s phrasing of Dhamma statements, there would be no ending of the Tath&#257;gata&rsquo;s quick-wittedness (in answering) questions; but those four disciples of mine, with their 100-year life span, living for 100 years, would die with the passing of 100 years.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c214"><span class="c0">Although the main thrust of this passage concerns the extent of the Buddha&rsquo;s knowledge, it also makes an important statement about how vast the topic of satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na is: Even with one hundred years of questioning, you couldn&rsquo;t exhaust it. </span></p><p class="c485"><span class="c0">The fact that DN&nbsp;22&rsquo;s treatment of the satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na is incomplete is also apparent from the organization of the sutta: The Buddha starts with a statement of the standard short formula for satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na: &ldquo;There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself&mdash;ardent, alert, &amp; mindful&mdash;subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. He remains</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c0">68 </span></p><p class="c252"><span class="c0">focused on feelings&hellip; mind&hellip; mental qualities in &amp; of themselves&mdash;ardent, alert, &amp; mindful&mdash;subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.&rdquo; However, the questions posed and answered in the course of the sutta explain and expand on only part of the formula: what it means to &ldquo;remained focused&rdquo; on each of the frames of reference in &amp; of itself. Among other things, there is no discussion of how ardency functions in the practice, of what it means to subdue greed and distress with reference to the world, of how the various frames of reference interact in practice, nor of what the stages in the practice are. For this information, we have to look at other treatments of these topics found elsewhere in the Canon. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">For instance, </span><span class="c85">M</span><span class="c107">N&nbsp;118</span><span class="c85">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">makes the important point that focusing on the breath can bring all four frames of reference into play simultaneously. In other words, the body in &amp; of itself is the main frame of reference, and the remaining three build on it. SN 47:40 mentions two stages in the practice&mdash; the establishing of mindfulness and the development of the establishing of mindfulness&mdash;adding that the second stage is accomplished by developing all eight factors of the noble eightfold path. Among other things, this means that not only does the establishing of mindfulness provide a foundation for right concentration&mdash;the four jh&#257;nas&mdash;but the mastery of the four jh&#257;nas also helps to develop the establishing of mindfulness even further. </span></p><p class="c137"><span class="c0">When we compare SN 47:40 with one of the refrains in DN&nbsp;22, we find three stages in satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na practice. </span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c0">The first stage, as applied to the body, is this: </span></p><p class="c160"><span class="c0">The monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself&mdash;ardent, alert, and mindful&mdash;subduing greed and distress with reference to the world. </span></p><p class="c56"><span class="c0">The three qualities at the center of this formula are also central to the practice of satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na. SN 16:2 shows that ardency is directly related to the practice of right effort. Thus mindfulness keeps the proper frame of reference in mind, alertness watches events related to that frame of reference, and these two qualities together give guidance to ardency so that it can, in line with right effort, abandon things that need to be abandoned, and to develop those that need to be developed.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">69 </span></p><p class="c461"><span class="c0">Although satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na practice is often said to be separate from the practice of jh&#257;na, a number of suttas&mdash;such as MN 125 and AN 8:63&mdash;equate the successful completion of this first stage with the attainment of the first level of </span></p><p class="c466"><span class="c0">jh&#257;na. This point is confirmed by the many suttas&mdash;</span><span class="c85">M</span><span class="c107">N&nbsp;118</span><span class="c85">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">among them&mdash; describing how the practice of satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na brings to completion the factors for awakening, which coincide with the factors of jh&#257;na. </span></p><p class="c415"><span class="c0">The second stage of satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na practice&mdash;the development of satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na &mdash;is this: </span></p><p class="c445"><span class="c0">One remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body, or on the phenomenon of origination &amp; passing away with regard to the body. </span></p><p class="c399"><span class="c0">The word &ldquo;origination,&rdquo; here, does not mean that one is focused simply on the arising of phenomena. Instead, it means being focused on how phenomena arise in connection with causes. The &ldquo;phenomenon of origination and passing away&rdquo; covers events either directly or indirectly related to one&rsquo;s chosen frame of reference. &ldquo;Directly&rdquo; means changes in the frame of reference itself. For instance, when focused on the body, one may notice what causes breath sensations to arise and pass away within it. &ldquo;Indirectly,&rdquo; here, means events in any of the other three frames of reference as they relate to the body. For example, one might notice what causes feelings of pleasure or mental states of irritation to arise and pass away in connection to events in the body. Or one might notice lapses of mindfulness in one&rsquo;s focus on the body. </span></p><p class="c392"><span class="c0">Of course, to see causal relations requires that the meditator consciously try to effect changes in events, to see which events actually have a causal relationship to one another and which ones don&rsquo;t. Here again, ardency in the practice of right effort and right concentration is what allows for this sort of understanding to arise. </span></p><p class="c178"><span class="c0">In every case, when skillful or unskillful mental qualities&mdash;such as the factors for awakening or the hindrances&mdash;arise and pass away, one is encouraged to foster the factors that strengthen jh&#257;na and eliminate those that weaken it.
