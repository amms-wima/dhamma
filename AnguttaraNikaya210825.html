This statement has engendered a great deal of controversy over the centuries. The commentary maintains that &ldquo;mind&rdquo; here refers to the bhava&#7749;ga citta, the momentary mental state between periods when the mental stream adverts to objects, but this statement raises more questions than it answers. There is no reference to the bhava&#7749;ga-citta or the mental stream in any of the suttas (they appear first in an Abhidhamma treatise, the Pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na); and because the commentaries compare the bhava&#7749;ga-citta to deep sleep, why is it called luminous? And why would the perception of its luminosity be a prerequisite for developing the mind? And further, if &ldquo;mind&rdquo; in this discourse means bhava&#7749;ga-citta, what would it mean to develop the bhava&#7749;ga-citta? </span></p><p class="c225"><span class="c29">Another interpretation equates the luminosity of the mind with the &ldquo;consciousness without surface,&rdquo; described as &ldquo;luminous&rdquo; in MN 49 and DN 11, but this interpretation also has problems. According to MN 49, that consciousness is not mediated by anything in the describable world, not even the &ldquo;Allness of the All,&rdquo; so how could it possibly be defiled? And, because it&rsquo;s not realized until the goal of the practice is reached, why would the perception of its luminosity be a prerequisite for developing the mind? And again, if &ldquo;mind&rdquo; here means consciousness without surface, how could the sutta talk of its development? </span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c29">A more reasonable approach to understanding the statement can be derived from taking it in context: the luminous mind is the mind that the meditator is trying to develop. To perceive its luminosity means understanding that defilements such as greed, aversion, or delusion are not intrinsic to its nature and are not a necessary part of awareness. Without this understanding, it would be impossible to practice. With this understanding, however, one can make an effort to cut away existing defilements, leaving the mind in the stage</span></p><p class="c112"><span class="c1">9 </span></p><p class="c493"><span class="c29">that MN 24 calls &ldquo;purity in terms of mind.&rdquo; This would correspond to the luminous level of concentration described in the standard simile for the fourth jh&#257;na: &ldquo;And further, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain&mdash;as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress&mdash;(the monk) enters &amp; remains in the fourth jh&#257;na: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. He sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness.&rdquo; From this state it is possible to develop the discernment that not only cuts away existing defilements but also uproots any potential for them to ever arise again. Only in the stages of awakening that follow on those acts of discernment would &ldquo;consciousness without surface&rdquo; be realized. </span></p><p class="c98"><span class="c2">See also: </span><span class="c13">A</span><span class="c10">N 10:61</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c199"><span class="c18">For the Benefit of Many People </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c18">Bahujanahit&#257;ya Sutta&nbsp;&nbsp;(AN&nbsp;1:140&ndash;141) </span></p><p class="c465"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Monks, any monks who explain not-Dhamma as not-Dhamma are practicing for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the benefit of many people, for the welfare &amp; happiness of human beings &amp; devas.

In other words, not allowing oneself to rest content merely with the skillful qualities developed on the path. In the Buddha&rsquo;s biography, this point is illustrated by his refusal to rest content with the formless absorptions he mastered under his first two teachers. See MN 36. Contentment, of course, is a virtue on the path, but as </span><span class="c207">AN 4:28</span><span class="c84">&nbsp;</span><span class="c29">shows, it is a quality to be developed around the material requisites of life. As this discourse shows, it is not to be applies to mental qualities.

The Commentary states that there were many more devas present at Ven.

Of these suttas, however, only MN 147 states that devas reached a noble attainment while listening to it. 5.&#256;ragga-ko&#7789;i-nitudana-mattam-pi (-matte-pi in the Burmese and Sri Lankan editions).

The Commentary identifies &ldquo;voice of another&rdquo; (parato ghoso) as meaning, in the case of the first sutta, the voice of another person teaching what is not true Dhamma, and in the case of the second sutta, the voice of another person teaching true Dhamma. </span></p><p class="c387"><span class="c29">However, Woodward&rsquo;s translation for the PTS renders parato ghoso as &ldquo;a voice from another world,&rdquo; and in a footnote he interprets it as &ldquo;clairaudience from another (world).&rdquo; To summarize his reasoning: If ordinary speech were meant, the word v&#257;c&#257; or v&#257;c&#299; would have been used instead of ghoso; and if another person were meant, a&ntilde;&ntilde;assa or a&ntilde;&ntilde;atarassa would have been used instead of parato. Finally, he notes that this passage appears also in MN 43 following a statement of &ldquo;abnormal powers,&rdquo; which apparently is meant to show that, in context, this statement must refer to the type of psychic knowledge that derives from abnormal powers. </span></p><p class="c74"><span class="c29">There are several problems with this interpretation, the first being that it leaves no room for an event happening many times in the Canon: people gaining right view simply on hearing the words of another person. One scholar has tried to get around this objection, saying that the voice from another world must refer to the voice of the Buddha or to one of the noble disciples who gained awakening on hearing the Buddha&rsquo;s own voice. The implication here is that only the words of these two classes of people can inspire right view. This position, however, is disproved by the fact that in Mv.I.23.5 Ven. S&#257;riputta, who at that point has not yet met the Buddha, is able to inspire the arising of the Dhamma eye in Ven. Moggall&#257;na. This passage appears in the long origin story leading up to the rules dealing with ordination, and makes an important point in validating the tradition of ordination: that a person who has not met the Buddha can still inspire right view and even awakening in the mind of another. So the Canon itself disproves both of these otherworldly interpretations of this statement. </span></p><p class="c239"><span class="c29">As for Woodward&rsquo;s linguistic arguments: It is hard for a non-native speaker of a dead language to know the reasoning in the mind of a native speaker in that language, but it might have been the case that the Buddha avoided the word a&ntilde;&ntilde;assa for &ldquo;other&rdquo; because it could have easily been confused for another meaning of a&ntilde;&ntilde;assa, &ldquo;pertaining to the knowledge of an arahant.&rdquo; As for v&#257;c&#299; and a&ntilde;&ntilde;atarassa, neither of them fits the context. V&#257;c&#299; is a stem-form</span></p><p class="c250"><span class="c1">30 </span></p><p class="c400"><span class="c29">used in compounds, and a&ntilde;&ntilde;atarassa means &ldquo;of a certain person.&rdquo; This leaves v&#257;c&#257;, &ldquo;statement&rdquo; as a possible alternative, but perhaps the Buddha chose ghoso to leave room for the possibility that there are times when one can bring another to his/her senses simply by clearing one&rsquo;s throat. </span></p><p class="c322"><span class="c29">Finally, concerning the passage from MN 43: This sutta is a long series of questions and answers that abruptly switch from topic to topic, so it&rsquo;s hard to say that the sutta provides a clear sense of context for any of its statements. That said, however, it&rsquo;s not even the case that this passage follows on a statement about abnormal powers. It actually follows on two questions about discernment, which in turn follow on a discussion of the formless jh&#257;nas&mdash; apparently the &ldquo;abnormal powers&rdquo; mentioned by Woodward&mdash;and as </span><span class="c207">AN 9:36</span><span class="c84">&nbsp;</span><span class="c29">and MN 140 show, it&rsquo;s possible to develop discernment based on these attainments without psychic powers. </span></p><p class="c379"><span class="c18">Without Investigating </span></p><p class="c111"><span class="c18">Ananuvicca Sutta&nbsp;&nbsp;(AN&nbsp;2:134) </span></p><p class="c109"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Endowed with two qualities, the fool&mdash;incompetent, a person of no integrity&mdash;keeps himself injured &amp; impaired.

Simply that I am beset by birth, aging, &amp; death; by sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, &amp; despairs; beset by stress, overcome with stress, (and I hope,) &ldquo;Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering &amp; stress might be known!&rdquo; Now, the Dhamma is well taught by the Blessed One, to be seen here &amp; now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be experienced by the observant for themselves.
